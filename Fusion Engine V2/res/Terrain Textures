Terrain Texture Management.

Terrain textures will be managed through a file with numerical values.
So if we assign grass and it's normal to one, and assign stone and it's normal to two,
then we can paint a path in the terrain data file by mixing the two numbers between pixels.
Example:
1, 1, 2
1, 2, 1
2, 1, 1

In the example above, you can see we have a stone path that starts in the bottom left, and 
moves to the top right. However, this path has sharp edges and no fade.
